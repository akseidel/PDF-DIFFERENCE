# PDF-DIFFERENCE  

- PDF-Difference uses both ImageMagick and GhostScript to combine the contents of two PDF
files such that the differences between the two show in the color red.

- The application is intended for use with pairs of PDF construction drawing plan sheets of the shame sheet number where one plan sheet contains revisions that may not be documented. The application combines the information from the two sheets. What is different between the sheets shows up in the color red.

### Use

- The application requires both ImageMagick and GhostScript to have been installed on the running computer in their standard install locations.
- The application also requires Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.dll, Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.Shell.dll, itextsharp.dll and itextsharp.xml to be in the folder where the executable PDF-DIFFERENCE.exe resides.
- The AlreadyBuilt folder contains the executable file and the other files mentioned above it needs to run.
- The user interface uses doubleclicking for adding to the files lists.
